## Model parameter estimation including uncertainty

\todo{What assumptions are / can be made?}


* Have a stationary process / series of residuals (trend and seasonality removed)
* Fit an ARMA model to the residuals 
* Estimate \phi, \theta and \sigma^2 when p and q are known.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Weakly / strictly stationary
  \item Causal
  \item Invertible
  \item Deterministic / Wold decomposition
  \item Existence and uniqueness
  \item ACF / PACF
  \item Zero-mean ARMA model?
  \item AICC criterion
\end{itemize}


### Notes

* ARMA models is a class of linear time series models
* ARMA is a parametric family 
* MSE of forecasts will depend on errors from estimation of parameters of the model (will be larger for higher-order models)
